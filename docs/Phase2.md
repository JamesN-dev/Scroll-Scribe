# 🚀 ScrollScribe Phase 2: CLI & UI Polish

## 🎯 Objective

Elevate ScrollScribe’s user experience by introducing an interactive configuration wizard, modernizing the CLI, and delivering a robust, visually appealing progress and status UI. This phase focuses on polish, usability, and maintainability—making ScrollScribe delightful for both new and advanced users.

## 📚 Required Reading (DO THIS FIRST!)

Before starting, the developer MUST read these files and resources:

### 1. Current Implementation Files

- `app/cli.py` — Main CLI entry point and subcommands
- `app/config.py` — Config file logic (to be expanded)
- `app/processing.py` — Core processing logic
- `app/discovery.py` — URL discovery logic
- `app/utils/` — Retry, exceptions, and (if kept) logging/progress utils
- `scribe_config.json` or `scribe.toml` — Example config file (to be generated by wizard)
- `archive/scrollscribe.py` — For legacy reference

### 2. Modern crawl4ai Documentation

**Use the Context7 MCP tool to read current crawl4ai docs:**

```bash
# Use: context7-mcp:resolve-library-id then context7-mcp:get-library-docs
# Focus on: session management, arun_many, MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher, BrowserConfig, config patterns
```

### 4. Questionary & Commitizen

- [Questionary Docs](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) — For interactive CLI prompts
- [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) — For possible inspiration on CLI UX and config flows

### 5. Context7 MCP

- Use for up-to-date crawl4ai documentation and best practices

```

- `scribe config` launches a Questionary wizard, saves config to file.
- All CLI commands load config file by default; CLI flags override.
- Rich/Typer/rich-click for colorful help and error output.
- Persistent, adaptive progress/status UI using Rich Panel/Rule.
- All features scriptable and CI-friendly.

## 📋 Phase 2 TODO Checklist

### 1. Fast Discovery Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **COMPLETED**: Replace legacy discovery with fast crawl4ai-based discovery
    - `fast_discovery.py` now provides `extract_links_fast()` using AsyncWebCrawler
    - CLI updated to use fast discovery by default (no more legacy bottleneck)
    - Discovery is now fast (seconds vs ~30 seconds previously)
    - Cache disabled by default to ensure fresh content for documentation
    - Legacy `discovery.py` marked as deprecated with clear migration path
    - Performance improvement: 5-10x faster discovery as planned

---

### 2. Fix Fast (Non-LLM) HTML-to-Markdown Mode

- [ ] Fix the existing `--fast` flag bug where it only processes 1 document but reports processing all found URLs
    - Current issue: `--fast` mode scrapes only first document despite finding multiple URLs
    - Ensure all discovered URLs are processed in fast mode (HTML→Markdown without LLM)
    - Verify throughput matches expected **50-200 docs/minute** performance
    - Test with multi-page documentation sites to confirm all pages are processed
    - Update progress reporting to accurately reflect pages processed vs found

---

### 3. Interactive Config Wizard

- [ ] Add `scribe config` (or `scribe wizard`) CLI command using [Questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary)
    - Prompts for: **output directory** (where to save processed Markdown), model, timeout, wait, prompt, and other key options
    - **Tip:** Wizard prompt and CLI help should recommend using a separate folder for each docs set (language, project, or version)
    - Saves selections to a config file (e.g., `scribe_config.json` or `scribe.toml`)
- [ ] Ensure all CLI commands load defaults from config file if present
- [ ] Allow CLI flags to override config file values, including `--output-dir`
- [ ] Document config file format and usage in README, with examples showing different output folders for different docs sets

---

### 4. CLI & Help Output Modernization

- [ ] Integrate [rich-click](https://github.com/ewels/rich-click) or [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) for colorful, readable `--help` and error messages
- [ ] Refactor CLI help strings for clarity, conciseness, and style
- [ ] Ensure all commands and options are discoverable and well-documented

---

### 5. Progress Bar & Status UI Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **COMPLETED**: Refactor to use a single persistent [Rich Progress](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/progress.html) instance for the entire run
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Use `progress.console.log()` for all status/info messages during progress (avoid breaking the bar)
    - All CleanConsole methods now support `progress_console` parameter
    - Pattern: `clean_console.print_url_status(url, "success", time, details, progress_console=progress.console)`
    - Implemented in `app/utils/logging.py` and `app/processing.py`
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Replace static separator lines with [Rich Panel](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/panel.html) or [Rule](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rule.html) for adaptive, attractive section headers
    - Progress bars now use clean, persistent display without breaking
    - Rose Pine dark theme implemented throughout
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Create a custom [Rich Progress](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/progress.html) bar with custom theme and style
    - Custom progress bar with URL display, ETA, and rate calculation
    - Consistent Rose Pine styling throughout the UI
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Ensure filtering and progress status remain visible and consistent throughout the run
    - Progress bars remain persistent during processing
    - URL-by-URL status logging without breaking display
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive logging documentation created (`LOGGING.md`)
    - Developer guide with patterns, best practices, and troubleshooting
    - Progress bar integration guidelines
    - Code examples and testing procedures

---

### 6. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Test interactive wizard and config file workflow (beginner and advanced flows)
- [ ] Test CLI-only usage (no Questionary dependency required for headless/CI)
- [ ] Validate progress bar and status UI under heavy logging and edge cases
- [ ] Solicit feedback from users on UX improvements

---

## 🏆 Success Criteria

- Users can configure ScrollScribe interactively or via CLI/config file, with no loss of scriptability
- CLI help and error output is visually appealing and easy to navigate
- ✅ **ACHIEVED**: Progress bar and status UI are persistent, adaptive, and never break due to logging or terminal size
- ✅ **ACHIEVED**: All improvements are documented and tested (comprehensive `LOGGING.md` guide created)

---

## 💡 Implementation Notes

- Use Questionary only in the config wizard; all other commands should work without it
- Prefer Rich’s adaptive UI components over static lines for cross-platform compatibility
- Consider backward compatibility for existing users/scripts
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented
