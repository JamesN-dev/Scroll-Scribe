## üìö Required Reading (DO THIS FIRST!)

Before starting, the developer MUST read these files and resources:

### 1. Current Implementation Files

- `app/cli.py` ‚Äî Main CLI entry point and subcommands
- `app/config.py` ‚Äî Config file logic (to be expanded)
- `app/processing.py` ‚Äî Core processing logic
- `app/fast-processing.py` ‚Äî Core processing logic for the --fast flag
- `app/fast-discovery.py` ‚Äî URL discovery logic
- [DEPRECATED]`app/discovery.py` ‚Äî URL discovery logic [DEPRECATED]

### 2. Modern crawl4ai Documentation

**Use the Context7 MCP tool to read current crawl4ai docs:**

```bash
# Use: context7-mcp:resolve-library-id then context7-mcp:get-library-docs
# Focus on: session management, arun_many, MemoryAdaptiveDispatcher, BrowserConfig, config patterns
```

### 4. Questionary & Commitizen

- [Commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) ‚Äî For possible inspiration on CLI UX and config flows

### 5. Context7 MCP

- Use for up-to-date crawl4ai documentation and best practices

- Rich/Typer/rich-click for colorful help and error output.
- Persistent, adaptive progress/status UI using Rich Panel/Rule.
- All features scriptable and CI-friendly.

## üìã Phase 2 TODO Checklist

### 1. Fast Discovery Implementation ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] **COMPLETED**: Replace legacy discovery with fast crawl4ai-based discovery
    - `fast_discovery.py` now provides `extract_links_fast()` using AsyncWebCrawler
    - Returns an ordered list of unique URLs, preserving discovery order
    - CLI updated to use fast discovery by default (no more legacy bottleneck)
    - Discovery is now fast (seconds vs ~30 seconds previously)
    - Cache disabled by default to ensure fresh content for documentation
    - Legacy `discovery.py` marked as deprecated with clear migration path
    - Performance improvement: 5-10x faster discovery as planned

---

### 2. Fix Fast (Non-LLM) HTML-to-Markdown Mode ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] **COMPLETED**: Fix the existing `--fast` flag bug where it only processes 1 document but reports processing all found URLs
    - Fixed: `--fast` mode now processes all discovered URLs in fast mode (HTML‚ÜíMarkdown without LLM)
    - Verified: All discovered URLs are processed in fast mode (HTML‚ÜíMarkdown without LLM)
    - Confirmed: Throughput matches expected **50-200 docs/minute** performance
    - Tested: Multi-page documentation sites now process all pages correctly
    - Updated: Progress reporting accurately reflects pages processed vs found

---

### 3. CLI & Help Output Modernization ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] **COMPLETED**: Replace argparse with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) for colorful, readable `--help` and error messages
    - ‚úÖ Converted `app/cli.py` from argparse to Typer
    - ‚úÖ Maintained all existing commands (discover, scrape, process) with bridge pattern
    - ‚úÖ Kept all existing functionality and options via `argparse.Namespace` bridge
    - ‚úÖ Added beautiful Gruvbox-themed help output with colors and formatting
    - ‚úÖ Better error messages and validation through Typer
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Add `typer[all]` to pyproject.toml dependencies
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Remove `rich-argparse` (redundant with Typer)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Refactor CLI help strings with rich examples and Gruvbox color scheme
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Enhanced command discovery with emojis and detailed examples
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Added shell completion support and clean imports

---

### 4. Config File System & User Configuration

- [ ] **Create `ConfigManager` class in `app/config.py` for user configuration**
    - Support a single, unified `scribe_config.json` file in the user's working directory.
    - The config structure will be simplified, removing the redundant `process` section. `scrape` settings will be the single source of truth.
    - Load defaults from the config file if present.
    - Allow CLI flags to override any config file values, ensuring scriptability.
    - Implement validation to ensure the loaded configuration is sound.
- [ ] **Integrate `ConfigManager` with the Typer CLI**
    - Use values from `scribe_config.json` as the defaults for all Typer command options.
    - Ensure the CLI override precedence is strictly maintained.
- [ ] **Document the `scribe_config.json` format and usage in the README**

---

### 5. Interactive Config Wizard & Direct Edit Command

- [ ] **Implement a smart `scribe config` command**
    - If `scribe_config.json` does not exist, the command will launch an interactive wizard (`questionary`) to guide the user through initial setup.
    - If the file *does* exist, the wizard will load the current settings and present them as defaults for each prompt, allowing for fast, safe edits of single values.
    - The wizard will save all selections to `scribe_config.json` in the current directory.
- [ ] **Add a `scribe config --edit` command for power users**
    - This command will open `scribe_config.json` in the user's default editor (`$EDITOR`).
    - **Crucially**, after the editor is closed, the command will immediately attempt to load and validate the file's JSON syntax.
    - If validation fails, it will inform the user of the syntax error and advise them to run the command again to fix it.
    - This provides a fast editing path while mitigating the risk of silent configuration errors.

---

### 6. Progress Bar & Status UI Improvements ‚úÖ COMPLETED

- [x] **COMPLETED**: Refactor to use a single persistent [Rich Progress](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/progress.html) instance for the entire run
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Use `progress.console.log()` for all status/info messages during progress (avoid breaking the bar)
    - All CleanConsole methods now support `progress_console` parameter
    - Pattern: `clean_console.print_url_status(url, "success", time, details, progress_console=progress.console)`
    - Implemented in `app/utils/logging.py` and `app/processing.py`
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Replace static separator lines with [Rich Panel](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/panel.html) or [Rule](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rule.html) for adaptive, attractive section headers
    - Progress bars now use clean, persistent display without breaking
    - Rose Pine dark theme implemented throughout
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Create a custom [Rich Progress](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/progress.html) bar with custom theme and style
    - Custom progress bar with URL display, ETA, and rate calculation
    - Consistent Rose Pine styling throughout the UI
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Ensure filtering and progress status remain visible and consistent throughout the run
    - Progress bars remain persistent during processing
    - URL-by-URL status logging without breaking display
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive logging documentation created (`LOGGING.md`)
    - Developer guide with patterns, best practices, and troubleshooting
    - Progress bar integration guidelines
    - Code examples and testing procedures

---

### 7. Testing & Validation

- [ ] Test the interactive wizard (`scribe config`) for both initial setup and editing workflows.
- [ ] Test the direct edit command (`scribe config --edit`), including the post-edit validation for both valid and invalid JSON.
- [ ] Test the CLI-only usage to ensure it remains fully scriptable and CI-friendly.
- [ ] Validate that CLI flags correctly override settings from the config file.
- [ ] Solicit feedback from users on the new configuration experience.

---

## üèÜ Success Criteria

- Users can configure ScrollScribe via a safe, interactive wizard or a direct edit command, with no loss of scriptability.
- CLI help and error output is visually appealing and easy to navigate.
- ‚úÖ **ACHIEVED**: Progress bar and status UI are persistent, adaptive, and never break due to logging or terminal size.
- ‚úÖ **ACHIEVED**: All improvements are documented and tested (comprehensive `LOGGING.md` guide created).

---

## üí° Implementation Notes

- Use Questionary only in the `scribe config` wizard; all other commands should work without it.
- Prefer Rich‚Äôs adaptive UI components over static lines for cross-platform compatibility.
- Consider backward compatibility for existing users/scripts.
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented.
