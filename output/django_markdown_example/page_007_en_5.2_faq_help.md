# FAQ: Getting Help

## How do I do X? Why doesn't Y work? Where can I go to get help?

First, please check if your question is answered on the [FAQ](../). Also, search for answers using your favorite search engine, and in [the forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/).

If you can't find an answer, please take a few minutes to formulate your question well. Explaining the problems you are facing clearly will help others help you. See the StackOverflow guide on [asking good questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

Then, please post it in one of the following channels:

- The Django Forum section ["Using Django"](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/users/6). This is for web-based discussions.
- The [Django Discord server](https://chat.djangoproject.com) for chat-based discussions.

In all these channels please abide by the [Django Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/). In summary, being friendly and patient, considerate, respectful, and careful in your choice of words.

## Nobody answered my question! What should I do?

Try making your question more specific, or provide a better example of your problem.

As with most open-source projects, the folks on these channels are volunteers. If nobody has answered your question, it may be because:
- Nobody knows the answer
- Nobody can understand the question
- Everybody that can help is busy

You can also try asking on a different channel. But please don't post your question in all three channels in quick succession.

## I think I've found a bug! What should I do?

Detailed instructions on how to handle a potential bug can be found in our [Guide to contributing to Django](../../internals/contributing/bugs-and-features/#reporting-bugs).

## I think I've found a security problem! What should I do?

If you think you've found a security problem with Django, please send a message to security@djangoproject.com. This is a private list only open to long-time, highly trusted Django developers, and its archives are not publicly readable.

Due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask that if you think you have found a security problem, *please* don't post a message on the forum, the Discord server, IRC, or one of the public mailing lists. Django has a [policy for handling security issues](../../internals/security/#reporting-security-issues); while a defect is outstanding, we would like to minimize any damage that could be inflicted through public knowledge of that defect.
