## Django Forum

Django has an [official Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com) where you can input and ask questions.

There are several categories of discussion including:

*   [Using Django](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/users/6): to ask any question regarding the installation, usage, or debugging of Django.
*   [Internals](https://forum.djangoproject.com/c/internals/5): for discussion of the development of Django itself.

Note

Before asking a question about how to contribute, read [Contributing to Django](../contributing/). Many frequently asked questions are answered there.

In addition, Django has several official mailing lists on Google Groups that are open to anyone.
