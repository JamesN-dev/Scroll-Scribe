## How the documentation is organized

Django has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it's organized will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [Tutorials](intro/) take you by the hand through a series of steps to create a web application. Start here if you're new to Django or web application development.
- [Topic guides](topics/) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Reference guides](ref/) contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of Django's machinery.
- [How-to guides](howto/) are recipes. They guide you through the steps involved in addressing key problems and use-cases.
