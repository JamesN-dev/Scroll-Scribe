If you’re new to [Python](https://www.python.org/), you might want to start by getting an idea of what the language is like. Django is 100% Python, so if you’ve got minimal comfort with Python you’ll probably get a lot more out of Django.

If you’re new to programming entirely, you might want to start with this [list of Python resources for non-programmers](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers)

If you already know a few other languages and want to get up to speed with Python quickly, we recommend referring the official [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/), which provides comprehensive and authoritative information about the language, as well as links to other resources such as a list of [books about Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks).
