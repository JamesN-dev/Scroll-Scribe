# How to Write a Custom Storage Class

If you need to provide custom file storage – a common example is storing files on some remote system – you can do so by defining a custom storage class. You'll need to follow these steps:

1. Your custom storage system must be a subclass of `django.core.files.storage.Storage`:

    ```python
    from django.core.files.storage import Storage
    class MyStorage(Storage):
        ...
    ```

2. Django must be able to instantiate your storage system without any arguments. This means that any settings should be taken from `django.conf.settings`:

    ```python
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.core.files.storage import Storage
    class MyStorage(Storage):
        def __init__(self, option=None):
            if not option:
                option = settings.CUSTOM_STORAGE_OPTIONS
            ...
    ```

3. Your storage class must implement the `_open()` and `_save()` methods, along with any other methods appropriate to your storage class. 

   - If your class provides local file storage, it must override the `path()` method.

4. Your storage class must be deconstructible so it can be serialized when used on a field in a migration.

By default, the following methods raise `NotImplementedError` and will typically have to be overridden:

- `Storage.delete()`
- `Storage.exists()`
- `Storage.listdir()`
- `Storage.size()`
- `Storage.url()`

## Key Methods to Implement

### `_open(name, mode='rb')`

**Required**. 
- Called by `Storage.open()`
- Must return a `File` object
- Should raise `FileNotFoundError` when a file doesn't exist

### `_save(name, content)`

- Called by `Storage.save()`
- `name` will have gone through `get_valid_name()` and `get_available_name()`
- Should return the actual name of the file saved

### `get_valid_name(name)`

- Returns a filename suitable for use with the underlying storage system
- Removes non-standard characters
- Retains only alpha-numeric characters, periods, and underscores

### `get_alternative_name(file_root, file_ext)`

- Returns an alternative filename 
- Appends an underscore plus a random 7 character alphanumeric string to the filename

### `get_available_name(name, max_length=None)`

- Returns a unique, available filename
- Ensures filename does not exceed `max_length`
- Raises `SuspiciousFileOperation` if a unique filename cannot be found

## Using Your Custom Storage Engine

To use your custom storage with Django:

1. Configure the storage in the `STORAGES` setting
2. Access storages through the `django.core.files.storage.storages` dictionary:

```python
from django.core.files.storage import storages
example_storage = storages["example"]
```
